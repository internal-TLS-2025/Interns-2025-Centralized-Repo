Bash script to monitor CPU and Memory usage on Linux 


#!/bin/bash
# This script monitors CPU and memory usage

while :
do 
  # Get the current usage of CPU and memory
  cpuUsage=$(top -bn1 | awk '/Cpu/ { print $2}')
  memUsage=$(free -m | awk '/Mem/{print $3}')

  # Print the usage
  echo "CPU Usage: $cpuUsage%"
  echo "Memory Usage: $memUsage MB"
 
  # Sleep for 1 second
  sleep 1
done

Common Environment Variables
Some commonly used environment variables include:
	• HOME: The home directory of the current user.
	• USER: The name of the current user.
	• PATH: A list of directories where the system looks for executable files.
	• SHELL: The path of the current user's shell (e.g., bash, zsh).
	• PWD: The current working directory.
Demonstrating the Use of Environment Variables in Scripts
Here’s a simple Bash script that demonstrates how to use environment variables:

#!/bin/bash
# Access and display environment variables
echo "Current User: $USER"
echo "Home Directory: $HOME"
echo "Current Shell: $SHELL"
echo "Current Working Directory: $PWD"
# Check disk usage in the home directory
echo "Disk Usage in Home Directory:"
du -sh "$HOME"
# Set a custom environment variable
export MY_VARIABLE="Hello, $USER! Welcome to your home directory."
1516# Access the custom environment variable
echo "$MY_VARIABLE"

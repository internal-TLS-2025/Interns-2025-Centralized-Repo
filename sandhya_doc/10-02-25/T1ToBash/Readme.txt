What I have done in this folder:

Creating Files: We wrote a script that asks for a name and creates a new blank file with that name.

Listing Files: We created a script that shows all the files and folders in the current directory you are in.

Displaying File Content: There is a script that asks for a file name and then shows what is inside that file, if it exists.

Copying Files: We made a script that allows you to copy one file to another location by asking for the names of the source file and the destination file.

Reading Last Lines of a File: We wrote a script that lets you see the last few lines of a specified file.

Removing Files or Directories: We prepared a script that prompts for a file or directory name and deletes it if it exists.

Listing Running Processes: There is a script that shows a list of all the processes currently running on your system.

Monitoring Processes: We provided a script that opens a tool to monitor system processes in real-time.

Killing Processes: We created a script you can use to stop running processes by their name.

Each of these activities is done using separate scripts, making it easy to run any specific task without combining everything into one script.
